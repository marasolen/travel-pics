            <p>
                I recently went on my first big trip since 2018! The main point of the trip was to attend the EuroVis
                conference in Luxembourg. I wasn't presenting anything there, but I hadn't been to a conference in
                person before so I convinced my supervisor Tamara to pay for part of the trip. To make it worth while,
                I decided to add on some personal travel in other cities as well. I first went to Toronto, where I 
                spent most of my time visiting with my friend Hayley who is living there for a couple months for a 
                CBC internship. Then I went to Amsterdam, since it is a city I hadn't been to before but that is
                supposed to be a fun place, and because tickets to the Schiphol airport are a bit cheaper. After that,
                I took the bus to Luxembourg for the conference. Finally, I flew to Oslo to visit with one of my host
                families from when I was on exchange in Norway.

                Some pictures from my time in Toronto. Hayley and I checked out the Royal Ontario Museum and walked
                around the city a bunch on the first day I was there, and we visited the Toronto aquarium during my
                last evening in the city. The aquarium was amazing, I'd recommend it to anyone visiting Toronto. I
                also appreciated the street art and murals in Toronto a lot!

                While I was travelling, I took a lot of pictures, and I stored them all in a Google Photos album. Now,
                I've extracted all of the metadata of the images and coded them all for the content of the image and
                the reason I took the picture. In this first visualization, you can see how the different contents in
                the images and the reasons I took the pictures changed over time, as well as when I tended to take
                pictures during my time in each city.

                In Toronto, most of my pictures are from my aquarium visit, which is why they're mostly of animals. In 
                Luxembourg, it was when I was on the city tour on the second day of the conference. In Oslo, it was 
                the first day when I was mostly just walking around and enjoying being back in Norway before I had 
                met my host family.
